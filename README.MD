# Example of initializing a Spring Application Context

This application demonstrates how to initialize a **Spring Application Context** which is the container that holds all
the beans of an application.

**ApplicationContext** is the interface that has to be implemented by all the application context implementations.

In this case, we are using **AnnotationConfigApplicationContext** which is an implementation of **ApplicationContext**
that can be used to load a Spring application context from one or more annotated classes.
